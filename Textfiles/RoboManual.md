## General Troubleshooting
To restart the visual sensors, send the bot the following Message:
"Hokus Pokus Camerus Restartikus" followed by it's unique Restarting Codec found in the Robocatalogue. WMR is never guilty, ask our lawyers and over 7000 successfull lawsuits against anyone who dares to challenge us. Please buy our products.
